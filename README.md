# KeyLoggerPy

A simple Python keylogger created as a learning project.

## About the Project

I'm learning Python and thought this would be a good beginner project. While challenging, I've learned a lot about Python and system interactions.

**Important Note**: This project is for educational purposes only. Use only on systems you have permission to monitor.

## evelopment Journey

- Started with the assumption this would be very difficult to implement
- Used AI for some complex parts where I got stuck
- Originally created a more stealthy version, but chose not to publish it because:
  - It contained malware-like functionality
  - The current version is detectable (unlike that version, Sometimes it would be pick up but somtimes not)

## Technical Details

Basic functionality includes:
- Keystroke logging
- Log file generation
